Do-While Loop Practice Questions:
Q1.  Take a number input from the user and keep halving it until it becomes less than or equal to 1, using a do-while loop.
Q2. Reverse the digits of a given number (input by the user) using a do-while loop. (Example: 123 → 321)
Q3. Print the Fibonacci series up to a given number using a do-while loop.
Q.4   Calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to a given number (input by user) using a do-while loop.
Q5.  Create a number-guessing game where the user has to guess a number between 1 and 10. The program will keep prompting the user to guess until they get it right, using a do-while loop.

Switch-Case Practice Questions:
 Q1. Write a program that takes an integer input from the user (1 to 7) and prints the corresponding day of the week (1 = Sunday, 2 = Monday, etc.). If the number is not between 1 and 7, print "Invalid Input".
 Q2.  Write a program that takes a character input from the user and checks if it's a vowel or a consonant using a switch-case statement.
 Q3.   Write a program that takes a month number (1 to 12) and prints the corresponding month name (e.g., 1 = January, 2 = February, etc.) using switch-case.
  Q4.  Write a program that takes a grade input (A, B, C, D, F) from the user and prints the corresponding result (Pass/Fail) using switch-case.
 Q5.  Write a program that takes an integer input and checks if it's positive, negative, or zero using switch-case.
